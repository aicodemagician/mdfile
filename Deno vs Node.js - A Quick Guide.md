# Deno vs. Node.js: A Quick Guide

This guide provides a high-level overview of the key differences between Node.js and Deno, helping to explain the reasoning behind the dual-workspace setup.

## Node.js

Node.js has been the dominant server-side JavaScript runtime for over a decade. Its strengths lie in its massive, mature ecosystem.

*   **Package Management:** It relies on the **npm** (Node Package Manager) registry, which is the largest software registry in the world.
*   **Modules:** It traditionally uses the **CommonJS** module system (`require()`/`module.exports`). While it has added support for ES Modules, the vast majority of its ecosystem is CommonJS-based.
*   **Tooling:** Core functionality like linting, formatting, and testing is handled by separate, community-driven packages (e.g., ESLint, Prettier, Jest).
*   **Permissions:** Scripts run with full access to the file system, network, and environment by default.

## Deno

Created by the original author of Node.js, Deno aims to be a more modern and secure runtime that addresses some of Node.js's historical limitations.

*   **Package Management:** Deno does not use a central package manager. Instead, modules are imported directly from URLs, making it more aligned with how browsers work.
*   **Modules:** It uses modern **ES Modules** (`import`/`export`) exclusively.
*   **Tooling:** Deno comes with a comprehensive, built-in toolchain. A linter, formatter, test runner, and dependency inspector are all included out of the box. This is the primary reason for separating it from the Node.js workspace, as these tools would conflict with ESLint and Prettier.
*   **Security:** Deno is **secure by default**. Scripts cannot access the file system, network, or environment variables unless explicitly granted permission via command-line flags (e.g., `--allow-net`, `--allow-read`).
*   **First-Class TypeScript:** Deno can execute TypeScript code directly without any manual setup or configuration steps.

## When to Choose Which

*   **Choose Node.js when:**
    *   You need to leverage the vast ecosystem of existing libraries and frameworks on npm.
    *   You are working on a legacy project or with a team that has a deep investment in the Node.js toolchain.
*   **Choose Deno when:**
    *   You are starting a new project and value security, modern JavaScript features, and an all-in-one toolchain.
    *   You want to work with TypeScript with zero configuration overhead.
